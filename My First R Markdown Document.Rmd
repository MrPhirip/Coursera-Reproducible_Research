My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here we are going to load some data

```{r currenttime}
time<-
```


```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.
I set echo=False to stop the code from echoing and appearing in the final document.

if i wanted ot hide the results, i would set results="hide"
```{r plot_pairs_airquality,echo=FALSE}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit<- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data= airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unorderd list:

* First element
* Second Element

- What's this
- and that?

1. one
0. two
3. three
